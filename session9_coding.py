# double and single quotes are identical for defining string text
print(d)

# in interactive window can write float(a) then str(a) and you now made a a string variable

#int(b) to round, then float(int(bb)) to make it a deciminal again 
#cannot turn a string variable into a number
#doing these commands in the interactive window does not save or override the interactive code but let's us experiment

#Fundamental tuypes of variables
#integers, float, boolean, complex numbers

i = True
j = False 
# these are the boolean variables. it is the same as factor variabnels in stata (1 is true, 0 is false)

# we can do algebra in the interactive window and permanently with the code in boolean
